Here are some different types of web developers, each of which focuses on a different aspect of the creation of a website.

Three main types of developers are 

FRONTEND  DEVELOPER,

BACKEND DEVELOPER, and

FULLSTACK DEVELOPER.



FRONTEND  DEVELOPER:

A front-end developer is someone who takes a client or design team’s website design and writes the code needed to implement it on the web. 

A decent front-end web developer will be fluent in at least three programming languages – HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


HTML allows them to add content to a website while splitting it into headings, paragraphs, and tables.

CSS lets a decent developer style the content and change things like colors, sizes, and borders.

JavaScript allows the inclusion of interactive elements, such as push buttons. We will go into more detail about these languages later.
